-   A STATIC array is a fixed length, indexed(usually zeroed) data structure.

-   When and where are static arrays used

    -   Storing and accessing sequential data
    -   Temporarily storing objects(most common)
    -   Used by IO(input/output) routines as buffers
    -   Lookup tables and inverse lookup tables
    -   Can be used to return multiple values from a functions
    -   Used in dynamic programming to cache answers to subproblems

-   Complexity / Big-O Notation Processing Time
    -   Accessing: Constant because arrays are indexed
        -   Static: O(1) ==> Big-O Constant
        -   Dynamic: O(1) ==> Big-O Constant
    -   Search: Linear because it is directly related to the size of the array
        -   Static: O(1) ==> Big-O Linear
        -   Dynamic: O(1) ==> Big-O Linear
    -   Insertion:
        -   Static: N/A ==> Static arrays are fixed in size
        -   Dynamic: O(1) ==> Big-O Linear
            -   All indexed values would shift, then be recopied at their new indexes. Therefore its linear
    -   Appending
        -   Static: N/A ==> Static arrays are fixed in size
        -   Dynamic: O(1) ==> Big-O Constant
            -   Constant because it doesn't happen very often???
    -   Deletion
        -   Static: N/A ==> Static arrays are fixed in size
        -   Dynamic: O(1) ==> Big-O Linear
            -   All indexed values would shift, then be recopied at their new indexes. Therefore its linear
